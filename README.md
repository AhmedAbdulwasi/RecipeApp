# Recipe React App
A simple Recipe website that uses Edamam Recipe API to generate recipes. It pulls important data such as the name of the recipe, calories rounded up, ingredients and more. It also has a search function where you can search recipes for apples, cocktails, chicken, etc.

## Why?
- I wanted a way that both introduces me to React and at the same time how I can pull specific data from APIs.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- React Javascript
- API: Edamam Recipe API
